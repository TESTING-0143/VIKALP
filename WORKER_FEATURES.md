# Worker Features Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the new worker functionality added to the Clean and Healthy Area website. Workers can now sign up, sign in, and manage work assignments through a dedicated dashboard.

## New Features Added

### 1. Worker Authentication
- **Worker Sign In** (`/worker-signin`): Dedicated sign-in page for workers
- **Worker Sign Up** (`/worker-signup`): Registration page with worker-specific fields
- **Role-based Authentication**: Workers are distinguished from regular users

### 2. Worker Dashboard (`/worker-dashboard`)
A comprehensive dashboard that includes:

#### Statistics Overview
- Total assignments count
- Completed assignments
- Pending assignments  
- Total earnings

#### Assignment Management
- View all work assignments
- Accept or reject pending assignments
- Mark assignments as completed
- Filter assignments by status (All, Pending, Accepted, Completed)

#### Assignment Details
Each assignment shows:
- **Title and Description**: Clear task description
- **Location**: Work location with distance
- **Time Estimate**: Expected duration to complete
- **Payment Amount**: Earnings for the task
- **Priority Level**: High, Medium, or Low priority
- **Status**: Pending, Accepted, Completed, or Rejected
- **Reported Date**: When the issue was reported
- **Image**: Visual reference of the issue

#### Quick Actions
- View Map: See all assignments on a map
- Performance: View detailed statistics
- Notifications: Check for updates

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- **Header Updates**: Worker sign-in/sign-up buttons in the main header
- **Auth Status Component**: Shows different options for workers vs regular users
- **Role Indicators**: Visual distinction between worker and user accounts

### 4. Worker Registration Fields
When signing up as a worker, users provide:
- First Name and Last Name
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Specialization (Garbage Collection, Street Cleaning, Drainage Maintenance, Park Maintenance, General Maintenance)
- Years of Experience
- Password and Confirmation

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context Updates
- Enhanced `AuthContext` to support role-based authentication
- Firestore integration for storing user roles and additional data
- Role validation during sign-in process

### Database Schema
Worker user documents in Firestore include:
```javascript
{
  uid: "user_id",
  email: "worker@example.com",
  displayName: "John Doe",
  role: "worker",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  specialization: "garbage-collection",
  experience: "3-5",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Routing
New routes added to the application:
- `/worker-signin` - Worker sign-in page
- `/worker-signup` - Worker registration page
- `/worker-dashboard` - Worker dashboard

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- **Orange/Red Color Scheme**: Distinct from regular user green theme

- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced user interaction feedback

### Mock Data
The dashboard currently uses mock data to demonstrate functionality:
- 4 sample assignments with different statuses
- Realistic location data and payment amounts
- Various priority levels and specializations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Location Tracking**: GPS integration for workers
2. **Push Notifications**: Instant updates for new assignments
3. **Photo Upload**: Before/after photos for completed work

## Security Considerations

- Password hashing and secure authentication
- Role-based permissions for data access

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive design

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for dashboard components
- Efficient state management
- Optimized re-renders
